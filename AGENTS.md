# Agent Instructions

Add `"use client";` as the top line of client components. The `use client` directive declares an entry point for the components to be rendered on the client side and should be used when creating interactive user interfaces (UI) that require client-side JavaScript capabilities, such as state management, event handling, and access to browser APIs. This is a React feature.

Do not remove any of my code comments unless I specifically ask you to do so, or you are removing the respective code block together.

Use `@` as the alias for the `src/` folder when importing modules, e.g., `import Hello from "@/components/Hello";`. Always put shared component files into the `src/components/` folder.
