# Next.js TypeScript Starter Template

This is a minimal Next.js project template with TypeScript and ESLint support. It includes essential configurations and dependencies to get you started quickly with building a Next.js application using TypeScript. This is based on the minimal manual install [as documented in the NextJS 16 docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation).

Clone Git repo to start your project minimally:

    git clone https://github.com/andygock/next-starter myapp
    cd myapp
    pnpm install

Then run the development server:

    pnpm dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Remove links to original GitHub repo when you start your own project, or you can entirely delete the `.git` folder and start again with `git init`.

    git remote rm origin

You may need to customise [next.config.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js) to your needs.
